aciccomp
========

Tools and data for the Atlantic Causal Inference Conference Competition.

Currently contains data from the 2016 competition in the form an R package (`aciccomp2016`). It can be installed from within R by executing:
  
    if (require("remotes", quietly = TRUE) == FALSE) {
      install.packages("remotes")
      require("remotes")
    }
    remotes::install_github("vdorie/aciccomp/2016")

The `tools` subdirectory contains scripts that may be of use in fitting a number of methods against a large number of data sets on a cluster and were used to execute the 2017 competition. These will likely require modification, as they are installation dependent.
